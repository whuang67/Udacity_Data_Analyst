# Data Analyst Nanodegree
## Project: Exploratory Data Analysis
### Install

This project requires **R** and the following R libraries installed:

- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.org/)
- [gridExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html)
- [ggfortify](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggfortify/index.html)

I highly recommend you choose [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) which makes R easier to use and includes a code editor, debugging & visualization tools.

### Dataset

This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

This [text file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEcwltBMlRYZT-l699-71TzInWfk4W9q5rTCSvDVMpc/pub?embedded=true) which describes the variables and how the data was collected should be helpful.
