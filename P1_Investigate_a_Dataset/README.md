# Data Analyst Nanodegree
## Project: Investigate a Ddataset

This project is an investigation of the Titanic passenger dataset using **Python 3.6**. It illustrates the entire data analysis process, from posing the relevant questions to finishing by sharing my findings on the same.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer and not the Python 2.7 installer. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Investigate_a_Dataset_project.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Investigate_a_Dataset/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Investigate_a_Dataset_project.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Investigate_a_Dataset_project.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

[Titanic Data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9a84c_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv): Contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. You can view a description of this dataset on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) website, where the data was obtained.
